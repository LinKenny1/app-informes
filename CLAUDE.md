### Technical Architecture Evolution

#### Database Schema Evolution
```sql
-- Original Schema (Basic)
clientes: id, nombre, contacto, telefono, email
proyectos: id, cliente_id, nombre, descripcion, estado
recursos: id, proyecto_id, tipo, archivo_path

-- Enhanced Schema (Current)
clientes: + direccion, tipo_industria, notas_generales, fecha_creacion
proyectos: + ubicacion, fecha_inicio, fecha_fin, fecha_limite, prioridad, presupuesto
recordatorios: NEW TABLE with full reminder management
```

#### Component Architecture Evolution
```
Initial: App ‚Üí [Clientes | Proyectos] ‚Üí ProyectoDetalle
Current: App ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Clientes ‚Üí ClienteDetalle ‚Üí ProyectoDetalle
                     ‚Üì
               Recordatorios (standalone)
```

#### API Endpoints Evolution
```
Original: Basic CRUD endpoints
Added: /api/clientes/stats, /api/dashboard, /api/recordatorios
Enhanced: Multi-file upload, comprehensive filtering
```

### Key Decision Points & Rationale

#### 1. Client-Centric vs Project-Centric Navigation
- **Decision**: Moved to client-centric approach
- **Rationale**: Users think in terms of clients first, then their projects
- **Impact**: Improved workflow efficiency and reduced cognitive load

#### 2. Mobile-First vs Desktop-First
- **Decision**: Complete mobile-first redesign
- **Rationale**: User explicitly stated primary mobile usage
- **Impact**: Bottom navigation, progressive disclosure, simplified layouts

#### 3. Professional vs Fun Theme
- **Decision**: Professional dark theme with no emojis
- **Rationale**: Business application needs professional appearance
- **Impact**: Comprehensive design system with CSS custom properties

#### 4. Kanban vs List for Mobile Projects
- **Decision**: Dual approach - Kanban on desktop, List on mobile
- **Rationale**: Kanban too complex for small screens, list more scannable
- **Impact**: Better mobile UX while preserving desktop functionality

### Conversation Context & User Feedback

#### User's Primary Concerns
1. **Mobile Usage**: "it will be mainly accessed on the phone"
2. **Information Overload**: "it could be better organized, its hard to understand all that's on screen"
3. **Professional Appearance**: Wanted to move away from "fun young look"
4. **Client-Centric Workflow**: Needed better client management approach

#### Implementation Decisions Based on Feedback
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Complete responsive overhaul with bottom navigation
2. **Information Simplification**: Progressive disclosure, hiding non-essential info
3. **Professional Theme**: Dark theme with business-appropriate styling
4. **Workflow Optimization**: Client ‚Üí Projects hierarchy instead of separate tabs

### Current Project State
